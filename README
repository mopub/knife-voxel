= Introduction =

knife-voxel is a plugin for the tool 'knife', part of the configuration
management system 'chef'.   http://www.opscode.com/.   It allows you to
provision Voxel dot Net (www.voxel.net) cloud instances (physical as
well as virtual) and then bootstrap them as chef clients.

This plugin is currently a work in progress, although all major
functions should work as expected.  The command set models Voxel's API
hAPI (http://api.voxel.net/docs/) .   We depend on the voxel-hapi
library for access to this API.   This will be replaced with a fog provider
based backend in the future.
